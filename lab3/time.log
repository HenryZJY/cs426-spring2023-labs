              30:45 TOTAL time spent

I discussed my solution with Xianglong Li. 

I encountered failures in tests in both Part A and Part B. In Part A, I encountered
 a problem of "at least one leader" during testing. I spent quite a lot amount of time 
 in going through the debug logs that I created to find that I forgot to clear a channel
 in the code. In Part B, I encountered a problem of "failure to reach agreement" during testing. 
 I spent the most time debugging this issue. I had to go through three major bugs in my completed
 to fix this issue. Again, it involves a lot of debugging logs to closely examine. The final bug
 turns out to be a simple reversed condition in the code. :(
