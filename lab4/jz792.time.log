I discussed the solution with Xianglong Li. 

For me, the most confusing part of this assignment was writing extra test cases for both 
the server and client. To mock the behavior of the server we need to first overwrite the server
responses, but I did not realized that first. Hence, I encountered nil pointer errors and I spent
quite some time debugging.
