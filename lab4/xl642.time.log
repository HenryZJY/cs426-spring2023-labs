I discussed my solution with: Henry Zhang

The biggest difficulty was to deal with a lock
situation when the server is updating its 
shard by requesting from another node while that
node is also requesting from this server. After
researching and testing, I realize that there
was a lock in the updating process while the rpc
call is being made, which conflicts with the lock
in the GetShardContents function. I solved this
by unlocking the mutex while waiting for rpc response
and thereby allowing the server to process incoming
shard copy requests.
