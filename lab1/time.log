I discussed my solutions with Xianglong Li. 

Adding codes with the mock user clients and mock video clients was quite cumbersome. 
Since the mocks and actual clients do not implement the same interface, I had to write
separate cases for mocks and actual clients, which seems unnecessary only for the 
purpose of unit testing. The fallback functionality also took much more time than I 
expected, since I spent quite some effort in debugging. It would be more reasonable to 
move section C2 to PartA so that I could know the amount of coding required for fallback
as well as write some simple test cases to make debugging easier.
