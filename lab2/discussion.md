With a client pool size of 4, I noticed there are 4-5 peaks in the load distributions for both user services and video services. Each of the peak is relatively thin. If I use a pool size of 1, I should see fatter curves with a higher latencies. In contrast, if I use a pool size of 8, I should see thinncer curves, more peaks and lower latencies.
