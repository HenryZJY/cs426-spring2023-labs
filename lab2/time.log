I discussed my solutions with Guanyi Su and Xianglong Li. 

Figuring out the specific commands in kubernetes yml files was the most challenging for me. 
I was unfamiliar with the specific architecure of kubernetes services, in particular, the dns
structures for different pods and services. Therefore, I got quite confused while Figuring
out the dns hostnames. In addition, I did not know about the yml syntax before this lab, so 
I struggled with the indentation, arrays construction in writing the yml files. I was also quite
surprised to see that we have to rewrite codes again (and again) in part C.
